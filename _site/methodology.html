<p>This project assumes that the user is unaware of the actual sequence of events and seeks to uncover them solely from the visualisation. Hence the methods outlined here can involve extra steps to cross check and verify if some assumptions made on the initial observations are consistent through. Since this dataset mimics an actual microblogging social network, there will be some inconsistencies in the tweets. In such cases, I had chosen to keep observations that are in line with the overall analysis and point out inconsistencies for readers to make further analysis.</p>
<p>A sizable number of messages in this dataset are retweets (RTs). In most microblog analysis, RTs are removed, leaving only unique messages as RTs are essentially duplicate messages that can skew the analysis. However, for this project, RTs are kept as the frequency of RT messages is an indication of how many authors are also experiencing the same situation as the RT.</p>

<p><em>plotly</em> is used to create an interactive graph to explore the relationship between the authors and the metrics. The coloured legend at the upper right-hand side allows users to click and filter the chart base on the metric they want to view. <em>plotly</em> also allows users to zoom in to view specific sections of the dataset in greater detail. A <em>tooltip</em> is activated upon hover so that the user can see all the metrics for that author.</p>

<p>Filtering for only <em>Number of Tweets</em> and <em>Number of Hashtags</em> by clicking on the legend, we see that there are two authors, <em>KronosQuoth</em> and <em>Clevvah4Evah</em>, who had posted huge number of tweets and hashtags. <em>Clevvah4Evah</em> sent an average of 4.7 tweets per minute with an average of 2 hashtags per text message. While <em>Clevvah4Evah</em> sent an average of 0.6 tweets per minute with an average of 3 hashtags per text message. From <em>tooltip</em>, we find that these two authors do not have any mentions or RTs, hence they look very suspicious and further exploration will be done to check if they are indeed authors posting authentic text or just spam bots.</p>

<p>Tweets by <em>Clevvah4Evah</em> are random statements that also contains several duplicated messages. They are mostly appended with <em>#POK</em> , <em>#Rally</em> and <em>#Grammar</em> but once again, the content is unrelated to the rally. We will drop these two authors from subsequent analysis as they are not meaningful.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-network-graph">Mentions Network Graph</h2>
<p>Even though we have removed 1418 records by filtering away <em>KronosQuoth</em> and <em>Clevvah4Evah</em>, the dataset is still too large to read all the entries in detail. I choose to use <em>RTs</em> and <em>mentions</em> as a blunt filter for the important messages because important messages are more likely to be echoed as a mention or RT by other users in the social network.</p>
<p>In our graph network, the edges will point away from the source author. For example <em>rrWine</em> posted the following message <em>” RT <span class="citation" data-cites="AbilaPost">@AbilaPost</span> POK rally set to take place in Abila City Park …”</em>. <em>AbilaPost</em> is the source of the message hence a link will point away from <em>AbilaPost</em> to <em>rrWine</em> in the network. The number of out going links shows how many messages by the source author has been retweeted and will be used as the weight.</p>
<p>To prepare the dataframe, I extracted all the mentions from each tweet using <em>str_extract_all</em> and a regular expression pattern. Next, <em>unnest</em> will convert the mentions into a row of its own. <em>group_by</em> and <em>add_tally</em> counts the number of mentions by the same author, which will be used as the weights.</p>

<p>For the node set, I extracted the set of unique authors from the <em>author</em> column and the set of unique <em>author</em> from the <em>mentions</em>. <em>visNetwork</em> requires the nodes labels to be named as <em>label</em>, so rename <em>author</em> as <em>label</em>. Use <em>full_join</em> to obtain all the unique authors from both sets.</p>

<p>Two common measures of the importance of a node in a network is the degree centrality and betweenness centrality. The strength is defined as the sum of the weights of all edges incident to a node. We calculate node strengths by passing the argument weights to <em>centrality_degree()</em>. Since our network is directed, we will use the out-strength as our measure of degree centrality.</p>
<p>Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. There are only 8 nodes with a betweenness score that is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Both degree centrality and betweenness centrality will be found using the <em>tidygraph</em> package. Visualising the top 10 authors for each measure using a bar chart created using the <em>ggplot</em> package.</p>

<p>There are some overlaps in the nodes identified by the centrality measures and we will take a closer look at them using a network graph.<br />
The <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggraph/versions/2.0.5">ggraph</a> package allows me to use the <em>centrality_closeness</em> as the colour and <em>centrality_betweenness</em> as the size in the network. The resulting static graph shows that there is a node with high closeness and betweenness centrality, however it is difficult to identify it as the graph is too cluttered.</p>

<p>I will use an interactive network graph of <em>authors</em> to visualise the <em>mentions</em> and <em>RTs</em> to overcome the issues in a static graph. The interactivity will allow me to visualise and identify important nodes in the network and <em>tooltip</em> will be used to display the <em>text message</em> so that I do not need to filter the data table for it. I will also use the network to further investigate the top authors identified by the centrality measures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visNetwork/vignettes/Introduction-to-visNetwork.html">visNetwork</a> package allows users to build interactive network visualisations. It was selected for its capabilities in handling large number of nodes by it <em>visPhysics</em> layout function, and also its intuitive <em>highlighting</em> and <em>drag</em> functions when analysing the graph.</p>
<p>When creating the network and testing the layout options, I found that <em>visPhysics</em> produces the best layout as the nodes are spaced apart with no overlaps and it is easy to see the nodes with the most edges. However, the network graph is too large for the graph to stabilise, ie. in the visualisation the network will not stop “trembling”. Running this option is also computationally taxing and graph will be slow to render. Hence, I will only show the screenshots of the network produced by <em>visPhysics</em> function and use the <em>visIgraphLayout</em> option in the code chunk below. The code chunk for the <em>visPhysics</em> function will be included in the appendix if the reader is keen to try it out another time.</p>
<p><img src="Img/visPhy.jpg" /></p>
<p>From the network graph, I first locate the nodes identified with high degree centrality scores. By hovering on their links to read some of their tweets, I discovered the outgoing links of the top nodes are retweets of informative news reports. Hence, I grouped <em>AbilaPost</em>, <em>KronosStar</em>, <em>CentralBulletin</em>, <em>InternationalNews</em>, <em>NewsOnlineToday</em> as <em>news</em>.</p>
<p><img src="Img/net_news.jpg" /><br />
Other authors with high degree centrality are <em>HomelandIlluminations</em>, <em>megaMan</em>, <em>truccotrucco</em> and <em>ben</em>. <em>HomelandIlluminations</em> is a very informative source, giving updates about a fire at <em>Dancing Dolphin</em> and the evacuation of residents. Furthermore, a possible hit-and-run, police stand-off, SWAT team and hostage scene were also mentioned.</p>
<p><img src="Img/HI.jpg" /></p>
<p>From their tweets, we learn that <em>megaMan</em>and <em>ben</em> knows each other, and they are passing information about a situation involving a black van and the police. Their most retweeted message was “<span class="citation" data-cites="ben">@ben</span> ITS THE SECOND VAN GUY!”. Examining the content of <em>megaMan</em> and <em>truccotrucco</em> reveals that they were both tweeting about a standoff between a black van and the police outside gelatogalore, with <em>megaMan</em> being a close observer of the black van and <em>truccotrucco</em> inside gelatogalore when the standoff was taking place.</p>
<p><img src="Img/mega.jpg" /></p>
<p>Other nodes with high degree centrality or betweenness scores are <em>FriendsOfKronos</em>, <em>POK</em> and * Choconibbs<em>. They were all mainly tweeting about the POK Rally, with </em>POK* giving updates and supporting the rally and <em>FriendsOfKronos</em> and * Choconibbs* criticising and dismissive of the rally. Tweets from <em>trollingsnark</em> were mainly criticisms or disparaging remarks. As his messages were not meaningful, we will exclude them for further analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>hngohebo_ABILAPOST</em> posted one text message and retweeted another. Both tweets were about a hit and run involving a bicyclist near Schaber.</p>
<p><img src="Img/hngohebo.jpg" /><br />
After exploring the network graphs, the nodes were grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>News: “AbilaPost”, “KronosStar”,“CentralBulletin”, “InternationalNews”, “NewsOnlineToday”</p></li>
<li><p>Official: “AbilaFireDept”, “AbilaPoliceDepartment”</p></li>
<li><p>Interest: “truccotrucco”, “megaMan”, “ben”, “Simon_Hamaeth”, “sofitees”, “hngohebo_ABILAPOST”, “HomelandIlluminations”</p></li>
<li><p>Others: the rest</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note that <em>Viktor-E</em> was the only author who mentioned himself. Also since regular expression was used to extract the authors in the mentions, a message with a missing space caused <em>dancingdolphin?#AbilaPost</em> to be recorded as a different author from the actual <em>dancingdolphin</em>. The error was easy to spot as the nodes were arranged alphabetically.</p>
<h2 id="dot-plot-of-rts-and-mentions">Dot Plot of RTs and Mentions</h2>
<p>After identifying key authors of information, I used an interactive dot plot to visualise their tweets in chronological order to understand how the events mentioned unfolded over the evening. Using <a href="https://plotly.com/r/">plotly</a> and the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/">crosstalk</a> package, allows users to filter for specific authors for different time periods.</p>
<p>I used the previously cleaned dataset of mentions and RTs as the <em>highlight_key</em> so that <em>mentions</em> will be a filter option. Next, some checkboxes and select filters were created to allow users to select the <em>timeframe</em>, <em>author</em>, and <em>is_RT</em>.</p>

<p>Filtering for all the news groups and <em>HomelandIlluminations</em>, laid out the events of the evening in chronological order.<br />
For example, <em>HomelandIlluminations</em> was the first to report the fire at Achilleos &amp; Madeg. Later that evening, <em>KronosStar</em> described an “erratic driver who ran a red light” at around the same time that <em>HomelandIlluminations</em> reported a hit and run. <em>KronosStar</em> subsequently reported that the driver was being cornered by the police in a parking lot near Alexandrias and Ithakis and later shots were fired. This led to APD units sent to the shooting area. And later <em>AbilaPost</em> reported that the stand off ends peacefully.</p>
